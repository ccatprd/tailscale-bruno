  # Update Policy File

  Replaces the live ACL policy for your entire tailnet. Changes take effect immediately for all devices.

  **Use "Validate Policy File" to test your policy before applying it here.**

  The example body is the default open policy (all traffic allowed). Replace with your actual policy.

  ## ETag support

  Add an `If-Match` header with the current policy ETag to prevent overwriting concurrent changes.
  Get the ETag from the `ETag` response header when reading the current policy.

  ## Response

  Returns the full updated ACL policy object with 200 OK.
