  # Suspend User

  Suspends a user's access to the tailnet. The user's devices remain but lose connectivity.

  A suspended user can be restored with "Restore User". Use "Delete User" to permanently remove them.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
