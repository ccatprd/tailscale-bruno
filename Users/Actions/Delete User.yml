  # Delete User

  Permanently removes a user from the tailnet. Their devices will also be removed.

  This action cannot be undone. Use "Suspend User" if you want to temporarily block access instead.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
