  # Set Device IPv4 Address

  Reassigns the device's Tailscale IPv4 address within the `100.64.0.0/10` CGNAT range.

  The address must be within the range and not already in use by another device. Use with care —
  changing an IP breaks existing connections to that device until clients refresh their maps.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
