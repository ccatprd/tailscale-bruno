  # Delete Device

  Permanently removes a device from the tailnet. The device will lose network access immediately.

  The device can re-join by re-authenticating if it still has a valid auth key or SSO login.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
