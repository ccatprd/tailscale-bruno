  # Delete Device Posture Attribute

  Removes a single posture attribute from the device by key.

  The `{{attribute_key}}` variable must be set to a valid `custom:` prefixed key (e.g. `custom:compliance_status`).
  Run "Get Device Attributes" first to see what keys exist, which will auto-set `attribute_key` in the environment.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
