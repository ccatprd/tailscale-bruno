  # Set Device Routes

  Sets the list of subnet routes that this device is allowed to advertise.

  This controls which routes are *approved* — the device must also advertise them via its Tailscale client.
  Sending an empty array (`"routes": []`) removes all approved routes.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
