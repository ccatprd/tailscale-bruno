  # Set Device Tags

  Replaces the device's ACL tags. Tags must match tag owners defined in your ACL policy, formatted as `tag:name`.

  This is a full replace — any tags not included in the array will be removed.
  Send `"tags": []` to remove all tags (converts the device back to a user-owned device).

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
