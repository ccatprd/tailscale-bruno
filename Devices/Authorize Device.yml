  # Authorize Device

  Authorizes a device to join the tailnet. Only required when device approval is enabled in tailnet settings.

  Set `"authorized": false` to de-authorize a device (blocks it from the network without deleting it).

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
