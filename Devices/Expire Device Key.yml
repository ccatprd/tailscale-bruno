  # Expire Device Key

  Immediately marks the device's node key as expired, forcing the user to re-authenticate on next use.

  Useful for security incidents where you want to force re-auth without fully removing the device.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
