  # Delete Key

  Revokes an auth key immediately. Any devices that haven't yet used the key will be unable to join.
  Devices already authenticated with this key are not affected.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
