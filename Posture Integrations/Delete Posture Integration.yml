  # Delete Posture Integration

  Removes a posture integration (e.g. CrowdStrike, Kandji, etc.) from the tailnet.

  The `integration_id` variable must be set. Run "List Posture Integrations" first to get the ID.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
