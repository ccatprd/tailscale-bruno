  # Update Service Device Approval

  Approves or revokes a device's permission to expose a specific service.

  Both `service_name` and `device_id` variables must be set. Set `"approved": false` to revoke.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
