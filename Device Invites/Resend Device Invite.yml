  # Resend Device Invite

  Resends the invite email for a pending device invite.

  The `device_invite_id` variable must be set to the numeric invite ID.
  Run "List Device Invites" first to get the ID.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
