  # Delete Webhook

  Permanently removes a webhook endpoint. No more events will be sent to it.

  The `endpoint_id` variable must be set. Run "List Webhooks" first to get the ID.

  ## Response

  Returns `null` (empty body) with 200 OK on success. This is expected — it does not mean the request failed.
